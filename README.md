This was the second project I completed during my internship. The main task was to select several small-cap stocks that we believed had strong growth potential but were undervalued at the time. We then built a portfolio and analyzed its performance using historical stock data through time series analysis to evaluate its investment prospects.

To optimize the portfolio, we applied the Black–Litterman model together with Markowitz portfolio optimization to determine the optimal asset allocation. In addition, we incorporated several technical indicators — SMA, EMA, MACD, and RSI — to support our trading simulations and investment strategy recommendations.
